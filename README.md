 3D Model to Robot Arm Movement (Onshape Integration)
This project demonstrates how to use a 3D model designed in Onshape to control the movements of a robotic arm. The STL file provided (Part Studio 1.stl) represents a custom-designed part that serves as a reference for robotic motion.

📌 Project Overview
🔧 CAD Design Tool: Onshape

🦾 Application: Translating 3D geometry into movement commands for a robotic arm

📂 File Provided: STL format of the 3D model

🎯 Goal: Teach a robot arm to mimic or interact with the form or path of a 3D object

🛠️ How It Works
Design the Part
The 3D object was modeled using Onshape and exported as an STL file.

Parse the 3D Model
The STL file is processed to extract key points or edges that the robot arm should follow or align with.

Generate Motion Commands
Using kinematic calculations or path planning algorithms, the robot arm’s joints are programmed to follow the geometry of the 3D model.

Execute on Robot
The generated commands are uploaded to a robotic arm (Arduino/ESP32/Raspberry Pi-based) to reproduce or interact with the shape.
